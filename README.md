TerpsTrade
=========
This iOS application has been designed to facilitate buying, selling, and trading textbooks between students. 

Install/Running
=========
Using a computer that has XCode (version 6.1.1) installed, you can run the app by downloading the zipfile, opening the .xcodeproj file, and building/running the project by pressing the top left arrow. Choose the iPhone 5 or 5s for the simulator near the top left, as this app has been optimized to run on those screen sizes.

The Three Tasks
=========
*1. Searching for a textbook*
---------
Using tghe search bar, a user can search for a textbook based on the subject. Currently, only the keywords "calculus" and "english" will give you any unique results because for the time being, only calculus and english books have been added to the database of textbooks.

Additionally, these postings are sorted by distance and uses the current location and puts the textbooks closest at the top.

*2. Posting a textbook for sale*
---------
Another part of this app is allowing the user to make a listing for their textbook that they want to sell, which can be accessed on the home page, by clicking "Create New Listing", or you can open the side menu by either swiping from the right side of the screen to the left, or pressing the top right icon and select "New Listing".

The user is required to take a photo of their book.

*3. Communication between the buyer and seller*
---------
Lastly, a buyer can contact the seller by going to the details page of a book, and pressing "Message" on the bottom left. This puts the buyer and seller in direct contact
